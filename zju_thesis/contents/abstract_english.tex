    Free-form deformation\cite{Sederberg86}(FFD) is a prevalent shape manipulation and shape animation method in computer graphics and geometric modeling. It is widely used in Computer-aided Design, Computer Animation, Medical Imaging and so on. On the other hand, FFD is also a framework of editing 3D models. On the basis of this framework, many researchers have proposed a lot of variants of FFD to improve its limitation, such as the aliasing of deformation result, the cumbersome interaction, low efficiency and so on.

    Cui et al.'s Smooth free-form deformation\cite{Cui15} is also a variant of FFD. In smooth free-form deformation\cite{Cui15} of a polygonal object, the linear geometry, e.g., triangles or planar polygons will be subdivided against a knot box, but it will produce pathological triangles which will contribute to many problems about efficiency and robustness. On the other hand, Cui et al. utilize the parallel computing power of the GPU via CUDA, which is limited to NVIDIA hardware. Thus, his method can not be used on neithor AMD GPU nor mobile platform. 

    In this paper, we propose an approach which will be used to clip the original model to avoid pathological case. Moreover, we implement the whole framework of smooth FFD with OpenGL compute shader in order to make it more general. Our subdivision method will produce sub-triangles as regular as possible, but cannot guarantee that each sub-triangle lies in a knot box. Accordingly the method will introduce acceptable errors. However, the trade-off is worthwhile in accordance with Error analysis. We also extend the deformation framework to the mobile phone by the aid of the across-platform of OpenGL. Finally, we contrast our method with the Smooth FFD and Accurrate FFD to show the advantage of our method.
