    Free-form deformation\cite{Sederberg86}(FFD) is a prevalent shape manipulation and shape animation method in computer graphics and geometric modeling. It is widely used in Computer-aided Design, Computer Animation, Medical Imaging and so on. However, there are some disadvantages in the FFD, such as the aliasing of deformation result, universality and robustness, low efficiency and so on. In order to address these problems, we propose the Improved Smooth Free-form Deformation.

    Our method will be used to clip the original model to avoid pathological case. Our subdivision method will produce sub-triangles as regular as possible, but cannot guarantee that each sub-triangle lies in a knot box. Accordingly the method will introduce acceptable errors. However, the trade-off is worthwhile in accordance with Error analysis. 

    Moreover, we implement the whole framework of Improved Smooth FFD with OpenGL compute shader in order to make it more general. We also extend the deformation framework to the mobile phone by the aid of the across-platform of OpenGL.

    Finally, we contrast our method with the Smooth FFD and Accurrate FFD to show the advantage of our method.
